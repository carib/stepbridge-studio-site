                    <p>As a solo owner/engineer on the premises I have made provisions to adhere to each of the following recommendations.</p>

                    <h3>Tips for Recording Studios, Audio Houses, Television Studios</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have handwashing stations, hand sanitizer, and disinfecting towelettes readily available.</li>
                        <li>Make sure performers know they have a choice of whether they feel safe to come into the studio. Please be accommodating to rescheduling sessions.</li>
                        <li>Common areas in facilities should be cleaned/sanitized regularly (e.g., light switches, surfaces, doorknobs, phones, water dispensers, coffee machines, cabinet handles, refrigerator handles, microwave buttons, ventilation grills, chairs and arm/back rests, etc.). Studios should be cleaned/sanitized before and after each session, including the microphone, POP filters, music stands and any other equipment the performer will come in contact with.</li>
                        <li>Schedule only one performer per session to allow for recommended social distancing.</li>
                        <li>Use disposable covers to protect mics. Sanitize or replace POP filters between sessions.</li>
                        <li>Allow performers to use their own headphones.</li>
                        <li>Limit the number of people at a recording session by having those who need to observe the session call in remotely.</li>
                        <li>Limit sharing of equipment as much as possible. Shared equipment should be disinfected after each use.</li>
                        <li>Use disinfecting towelettes to wipe down equipment before and after use.</li>
                        <li>Offer to wipe down the equipment in the presence of the performer to reassure them of what has been cleaned before the work.</li>
                        <li>Engineers, second engineers and tape ops should use rubber gloves whenever possible when setting up the room, moving mics, booms, music stands, chairs, gobo's, and resetting channels and outboard gear, and should dispose of them frequently.</li>
                    </ul>
