                <div class="terms-section">
                    <h3>Billing Info</h3>
                    <p><strong>NOTE - Sessions will not be confirmed without the following:</strong></p>
                    <p>Name and physical address of parent company, name and physical address of project company, name of job, contact person, position, physical address, P.O. number, etc. + name and email of invoice recipient if different from contact person. Also, let me know of any additional information you may need from me to ensure prompt payment.</p>
                    <p><strong>Overseas Clients:</strong> If I have not worked with you before, I will require Credit Card payment for service.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="terms-section">
                    <h3>Calendar Holds</h3>
                    <p><strong>CALENDAR HOLDS will automatically expire 3 days from date granted.</strong></p>
                    <p>Stepbridge Studios is a small facility; it is the only commercial, professional studio providing a unique service to Santa Fe and adjacent areas. I receive many requests for services and I cannot navigate through countless HOLDS and attend scheduling and booking effectively.</p>

                <div class="terms-section">
                    <h3>Confirmed Sessions</h3>
                    <p><strong>All confirmed sessions will be billed in full.</strong> If you request and I confirm a booking, you will be billed for the total confirmed time, at the rate according to the session format (ADR, VO, SOURCE CONNECT, etc), as advertised under "SERVICES & RATES" tab.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="terms-section">
                    <h3>Bumps, Pads & Safeties</h3>
                    <p>When booking sessions you will be billed for extended time request (i.e. 1 hour + .5 hr Bump). I cannot market additional time that you request; this time will be billed at Studio Hourly Rate of $85/hr when not used by your session. If the time is used to satisfy your session requirements, the time will be billed at full session rate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="terms-section">
                    <h3>Pre & Post Session Prep</h3>
                    <p>I strive to fulfill your session needs within the confirmed session time quoted and booked. All additional Pre and Post session work is billed at Studio Hourly Rate of $85/hr (i.e. downloading session elements, session setup & test, ISDN test connections, obtaining document signatures, printing & scanning documents, Post session prepping and uploading of session Deliverables, etc).</p>
